# Trip Duration Optimization
A common problem in the road infrastructure of metropolitan cities around the world is intense traffic congestion. Many of these problems can be addressed by shared economy. One individual can use another’s resources for a short period of time to gain immediate benefits. Recently some countries use vehicle sharing as a necessity. One of the most interesting ways of sharing is either car or taxi sharing. Finding efficient vehicle routes is also an important problem. The reduction of delivery time and length is a challenging issue. Here, we handled the trip duration optimization problem for taxi vehicles. Traveling Salesman Problem framed here as a well-known research problem. The objective is to find the shortest route that visits a set of locations. Optimization techniques are required to intelligently search the solution space and ﬁnd near-optimal solutions. Firstly, for every pair of pick-up and drop-off locations XGBoost model  used  to predict trip duration between them. Ant colony and genetic evolutionary algorithm used to find the best travel itinerary for the vehicles.
